      <h2>skip if you don’t like intros</h2>

      <p>
        Few days back, I was tasked on a project. This app will be written in
        React. State management will be with Apollo with a backend in GraphQL.
        The way I learn new things is I do a very basic course to get the feel
        of it. I look for a free course, so that I can share it with the
        community. GraphQL being relatively new has fewer courses online. I did
        find a lot of resources both free and paid which I will review some day
        but this one course stands out. I have recommended this course to a lot
        many people I know.
      </p>

      <h2>let’s talk about the course</h2>

      <p>
        Netninja along with freeCodeCamp has come up with this amazing course.
        Here’s the link. It’s free. I have embed the entire playlist below, you
        can watch it right here.
      </p>

      <div>

      </div>

      <h3>rating 4/5</h3>

      <p>
        While this course covers a lot of ground, it misses few. Also, it is
        little bit outdated. Nonetheless, the course is still my favorite for
        beginners.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>pace</strong> is remarkably right, it’s neither too fast that
        you have to go back nor slow that you start doozing
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>full screencast</strong>full screencast of code, I like where I
        don’t have to see someone’s face too much and the instructor explains
        things on codepad. So, this was a huge +
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>great example</strong> for the entire tutorial as it covers why
        GraphQL is an ideal solution. TODO apps wouldn’t do justice to the
        concepts of GQL.
      </p>

      <h3>what you need to know to do this course?</h3>
      <p>
        To do this course you need to know the following pieces of technology:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>ExpressJS</li>
        <li>ReactJS</li>
        <li>CSS & HTML</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you don’t know any of these, there are tutorials on NetNinja itself
        to help you with it. If you know all of it, (like I did), nothing can be
        better than this.
      </p>

      <h3>what you get to learn from this course?</h3>
      <p>
        This is a full stack graphQL course. It covers everything you would need
        to make a graphQL app.
      </p>

      <h4>FOR THE BACKEND</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mutations</li>
        <li>Queries</li>
        <li>Resolvers</li>
        <li>GraphiQL</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>ON THE FRONTEND</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>query/mutation fire</li>
        <li>parameterized query</li>
        <li>composing multiple query</li>
        <li>refetching queries on mutation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>after the course</h2>
      <p>
        As I said earlier, the course left a lot of grounds to cover. After you
        have done the basics you can learn about:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>graphql subscriptions</li>
        <li>@client i.e. managing local state</li>
        <li>typescript support</li>
        <li>authentication/authorization in the app</li>
        <li>writing tests for graphql query/mutations</li>
        <li>paginated queries</li>
        <li>
          most important: using apolloclient as renderProps which is the current
          API being used in apollo’s documentation and everywhere in code.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>where can I see the final product?</h2>
      <p>
        If you follow and complete the entire course, you make something like
        this: my booklist app.<br />
        However, the course doesn’t cover how to host it online. I have hosted
        the entire frontend and backend server for free. If you like to know how
        to host a React+GraphQL app, subscribe to the newsletter below and
        whenever I write it, you’ll get it straight into your inbox.
